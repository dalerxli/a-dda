Creation of shape files for ADDA using Hyperfun - hyperfun.org

1) Create Hyperfun input file, or use example example.hf, which describes a deformed prolate spheroid (as used in doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0889.2011.00559.x)
2) Create WRL file, using the HyperFun Polygonizer (Windows), available from hyperfun.org
  a) Start command prompt under Windows
  b) Change to directory where the Hyperfun input file are
  c) Execute Hyperfun using "PATH\hfp example.hf -wrl example.wrl -g 180"; it creates a file in the WRL format, containing a surface description of the particle; the option "-g" sets the grid density of this file
3) Convert WRL file to OBJ file: open WRL file with Accutrans (Windows) and save it as a Wavefront OBJ file. Accutrans is available from http://www.micromouse.ca/
4) Compile "Point in Polyhedron" from Roman Schuh (under Linux), name of executable should be "pip".
5) Compile "calc_pip_arg.f90" (under Linux), name of executable should be "calc_pip_arg".
6) Adjust "make_datfiles": Variable "dpl" defines the number of dipoles per wavelength, array "size_array" defines the size parameters, the files should be created for.
7) Run "./make_datfiles" with the name of the obj-file, without suffix, as argument, for example "./make_datfiles example": This will create the files for ADDA. The shape file for size parameter 12.0, for example will be example_12.0.dat. The computation time can be very long (several days).
