Additionally to ADDA executables, this folder contains all required DLLs. Hence, these executables are ready to run.

Executables of misc/ packages are located in separate folders for convenience, but they may also require some of these
DLLs. For instance, those based on Fortran code require:
libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll
libgfortran-3.dll
libquadmath-0.dll

In general, one either need to add path to required DLLs to the PATH environmental variable or to keep executables and
DLLs in the same folder.
