This folder contains ADDA executables for 32-bit Windows and all required DLLs. Hence, these executables are ready to
run. However, all auxilliary files, like the manual or sample input files, are supplied with the main ADDA package, 
which should be obtained separately.

Executables of misc/ packages are located in separate folders for convenience, but they may also require some of these
DLLs. For instance, those based on Fortran code require:
libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll
libgfortran-3.dll
libquadmath-0.dll

In general, one either need to add path to required DLLs to the PATH environmental variable or to keep executables and
DLLs in the same folder.
